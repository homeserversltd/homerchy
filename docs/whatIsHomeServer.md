# What Is HOMESERVER?

HOMESERVER is a professional-grade digital sovereignty platform that delivers enterprise-level infrastructure in a single system. It is not a consumer appliance—it is a complete datacenter-in-a-box designed for privacy-conscious professionals who refuse to rent their digital lives from Big Tech.

## Mission Statement

**You should own your digital infrastructure, not rent it from Big Tech.** Every person and business deserves complete control over their network and data—without depending on companies that profit from monitoring your online activity while charging you monthly fees.

We build professional-grade network solutions that run entirely under your control. No subscriptions, no surveillance, no compromises.

## Core Value Proposition

**Pay Once. Own Forever. Control Everything.**

HOMESERVER replaces $3,000+ in annual subscriptions with infrastructure you own forever. Instead of paying monthly fees to companies that spy on you, you run everything yourself on hardware you control completely.

## Technical Philosophy

### Complexity as a Feature

**Target Audience:**
- System administrators who refuse to rent their digital life
- Privacy-conscious professionals who understand data sovereignty value
- Tech enthusiasts wanting complete control over their digital stack
- Small businesses needing on-premise enterprise solutions

**Technical Requirements:**
- Router bridge mode configuration capability
- System administrator level understanding
- Network configuration knowledge
- Willingness to invest time in proper setup

### Anonymous Operation, Transparent Actions

HOMESERVER LLC maintains team anonymity to protect independence while conducting business transparently:

- **Anonymous principals** protect our independence from corporate retaliation
- **Transparency through action**: Code is open-source, hardware specifications are published, business practices are straightforward
- **Focus on products** rather than defending personal identities
- **No pressure** to weaken security or add backdoors
- **Demonstrates accountability** without requiring personal exposure

We stay anonymous not to hide our work, but to protect our independence and your privacy.

## Vision

**A home.arpa domain behind every modem.** Modern hardware has reached a turning point that society hasn't caught up with yet: what used to require an entire data center can now run on a device smaller than your router. The hardware is powerful enough, compact enough, and inexpensive enough that professional-grade infrastructure can exist on every network.

Every internet connection can have its own private domain with enterprise-level services. The technology isn't expensive anymore—it's practically free. The hardware capability already exists. We're just the first to recognize what's now possible.

**We're building a complete digital sovereignty toolkit.** Our roadmap includes expanded .arpa domain solutions, seamless mobile device integration, and simple backup systems—all designed to bring professional-grade privacy to technical users who refuse to give up ownership of their data.

## Core Philosophy

Your network infrastructure should be **privately owned**, **personally controlled**, and **professionally capable**. We reject the false choice between convenience and privacy. You can have both.

This is networking done right: owned, operated, and controlled by you.

## The Problem HOMESERVER Solves

- LastPass ($36/yr) + Plex Pass ($120/yr) + VPN ($60/yr)
- Cloud Storage ($240/yr) + Photo Storage ($120/yr)
