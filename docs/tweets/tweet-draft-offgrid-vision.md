# Tweet Draft: Off-Grid Vision

## Option 1 (Architecture-Focused)

HOMESERVER backend and HOMERCHY frontend are purpose-built with low power consumption as a core design constraint. This isn't an afterthought—both systems are architected from the ground up to operate efficiently on minimal power draw.

The low power consumption enables off-grid deployment via solar panels and battery systems. You can run complete digital sovereignty infrastructure without grid dependency. The backend handles data, logic, and storage; the frontend handles playback, management, and display—both optimized for off-grid operation.

Purpose-built front and backend means no compromises. This isn't repurposed consumer hardware or cloud services adapted for local use. Both systems are designed specifically for everyone who wants complete digital sovereignty without grid dependency.

## Option 2 (Vision-Forward)

Vision: HOMESERVER backend and HOMERCHY frontend consume minimal power, enabling off-grid operation. The backend provides enterprise-grade services (Jellyfin, Vaultwarden, Gogs, etc.) while the frontend delivers a polished client OS—both designed to run on solar/battery systems.

The architecture is purpose-built. Unlike consumer NAS devices or cloud services adapted for local deployment, both frontend and backend are optimized for low-power deployment from the start. This means complete digital sovereignty that runs independently of grid infrastructure.

Purpose-built front and backend for everyone. The low power consumption and off-grid capability aren't niche features—they're core to the design. Complete control over your digital infrastructure, running on hardware you own, powered by systems you control, independent of grid dependency.
