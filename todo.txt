https://github.com/homeserversltd/homerchy/releases need to make this do something

## Overarching story

**1. Put back install content under the new paradigm**

The first-boot install engine works (orchestrator, state, reporting, TTY). Phases run but are stubs. We need to implement real logic in deployment/install per the new paradigm:

- Python-only, no shell; phases mutate state, main owns display
- Use OLD_BEHAVIOR docs and git history to steal only what we need
- Phases: preflight (partially done), packaging, config, login, first-run, display-test (stub), hacker-demo (done), post-install

See: firstBootTTY.md, deployment/ADD_BACK_CHECKLIST.md, deployment/install/README.md

**2. Figure out homerchy/src and get it sorted**

src/ is the "installed" Homerchy payload: applications/, bin/ (100+ scripts), config/, default/, migrations/ (93 .sh), themes/, merge-tool/. It feeds into the install (packaging deploys packages, config deploys configs, etc.). Needs:

- Audit: what lives where, what's used, what's orphaned
- omarchy vs homerchy naming (src/bin still has omarchy-*; transition may be incomplete)
- How migrations tie to install; which configs map to which phases
- Clear contract: src/ layout vs what install phases deploy

**3. Then**

Releases page, polish, whatever comes next.
